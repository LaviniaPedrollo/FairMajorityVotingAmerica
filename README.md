# FairMajorityVotingAmerica
The repository contains two main files:
1) Run main.py to apply Fair Majority voting to 2018 U.S. elections. The code is commented in order to let the user understand the main algorithm and the whole process.
2) Run example_connecticut.py to countercheck that the correct result is obtained by using the same dataset and example proposed as in the lecture.
The CSV file 1976-2018-house2.csv is used within main.py and can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset?select=1976-2018-house2.csv
